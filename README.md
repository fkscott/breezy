_don't stress about styling._

This css was heavily inspired by [sakura](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura), and I wanted to tailor it specifically to outlines I export using [bike-to-html](https://github.com/fkscott/bike-to-html). It was also a great lesson in building a simple design system and compiling styles with SASS.

I tweaked the colors, spacing, and font sizes.
